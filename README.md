# CNN to predict the MNIST handwritten digit dataset
I used TensorFlow to create a CNN to predict the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. I trained this CNN solely as an excuse to become familiar with TensorFlow. The final prediction accuracy was 98.45% on the test dataset, which is typical for this dataset.
